# Wolfram-Alpha-for-Echo
A python script that hooks wolfram alpha to the amazon echo. Works with normal questions as well as calculus :D (hopefully)

## How to get this thing to work:

What you need first is a **Wolfram Alpha App ID**. This allows you to access the API as a developer, which you kind of need to do anything. To get one, go to https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signin.html and log in to the Developer Portal using your Wolfram ID (if you don't have one of those, go to https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signup.html). Click the "Get an AppID" button, and bam, there's your AppID.
